A small timelapse video with RT-22 radio telescope. It was the last day of an astronomical festival 
and I wanted to make something incredible. Timelapse videos are not something I am good at but this one 
I really like.

It was the first time I used "Magic Lantern" utility. I really thought I set it up right 
but now after a year I see that night frames are underexposured :(
