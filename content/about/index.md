## About

My name is Eugene Shishkin. Currently, I live in Izhevsk, Russia.

I am a software developer with 10+ years of experience. Though I have been working in the same company for several years, 
I have a lot of different projects done. Mostly I use Java language, but tried JS/Python in my side projects. 
My official CV can be found [here](https://eshishkin.github.io/cv/).

Needless to say that software development is not the only option I like. 
Apart from sitting in front of my laptop and coding I also like

- Astronomy and astrophotography (I have 10 inch dobsonian for that :))
- Photography
- Hiking and travelling

I create this site because I want to write my thoughts about tech and investments, 
review cities I have been, share my pictures and just have fun.
